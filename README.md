# Time-Series-Analysis_Homewok
## In this assignment I was tasked to look at the behavior of the yen using a time series analysis and Regression analysis. 
## I was able to do the time series analysis by creating 3 different models (ARMA, ARIMA and GARCH). Also, for the Regression analysis, I used the sklearn to import LinearRegression and model it.
## My findings on the Time Series Analysis were that ARMA and ARIMA did not perform well because the P results were higher than 0.5. However, the GRACH model was more precise at predicting the volatity of the Yen which is a good indicator to buy into derivatives.
## The Linear Regression model compared two types of datas In sample and Out of Sample data. I was able to get the root mean square of both datas. I concluded that the In Sample RMSE is higher than the Out of Sample data which makes the Out of Sample data better.
